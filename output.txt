Although this book is titled The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success,  it could also be called The
Seven Spiritual Laws of Life,  because these are the same principles that nature uses to create
everything in material existence  everything we can see, hear, smell, taste, or touch.
In my book, Creating Affluence: Wealth Consciousness in the Field of All Possibilities,  I
have outlined the steps to wealth consciousness based on a true understanding of the workingsof nature. The Seven Spiritual Laws of  Success form the essence of this teaching. When this
knowledge is incorporated in your consciousness, it will give you the ability to create unlimited
wealth with effortless ease, and to experience success in every endeavour.
Success in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progres-
sive realization of worthy goals. Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease.And yet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to be a process
that requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at the expense of others. We need a
more spiritual approach to success and to affluence, which is the abundant flow of all goodthings to you. With the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmonywith nature and create with carefulness, joy, and love.
There are many aspects to success; material wealth is only one component. Moreover,
success is a journey, not a destination. Material abundance, in all its expressions, happens to be
one of those things that makes the journey more enjoyable. But success also includes goodhealth, energy and enthusiasm for life, fulfilling relationships, creative freedom, emotional andpsychological stability, a sense of well-being, and peace of mind.
Even with the experience of all these things, we will remain unfulfilled unless we nurture the
seeds of divinity inside us. In reality, we are divinity in disguise, and the gods and goddesses in
embryo that are contained within us seek to be fully materialized. True success is therefore the
experience of the miraculous. It is the unfolding of the divinity within us. It is the perception ofdivinity wherever we go, in whatever we perceive  in the eyes of a child, in the beauty of aflower, in the flight of a bird. When we begin to experience our life as the miraculous expressionof divinity  not occasionally, but all the time  then we will know the true meaning of success.
Before defining the seven spiritual laws, let us understand the concept of law. Law is the
process by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest; its the process by which the observerbecomes the observed; its the process by which the seer becomes the scenery; its the processthrough which the dreamer manifests the dream.
All of creation, everything that exists in the physical world, is the result of the unmanifest
transforming itself into the manifest. Everything that we behold comes from the unknown. Our
physical body, the physical universe  anything and everything that we can perceive throughour senses  is the transformation of the unmanifest, unknown, and invisible into the manifest,known, and visible.
The physical universe is nothing other than the Self curving back within Itself to experience
Itself as spirit, mind, and physical matter. In other words, all processes of creation are processes
through which the Self or divinity expresses Itself. Consciousness in motion expresses itself asthe objects of the universe in the eternal dance of life.
The source of all creation is divinity (or the spirit); the process of creation is divinity in
motion (or the mind); and the object of creation is the physical universe (which includes the
physical body).These three components of reality  spirit, mind, and body, or observer, the process of
observing, and the observed  are essentially the same thing. They all come from the same
place: the field of pure potentiality which is purely unmanifest.
The physical laws of the universe are actually this whole process of divinity in motion, or
consciousness in motion. When we understand these laws and apply them in our lives, anythingwe want can be created, because the same laws that nature uses to create a forest, or a galaxy,or a star, or a human body can also bring about the fulfillment of our deepest desires.
Now lets go over The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success  and see how we can apply them in
our lives.1
The law of pure
potentialityThe source of all creation is pure consciousness, pure potentiality seeking expression from
the unmanifest to the manifest.
And when we realise that our true Self is one of pure potentiality, we align with the power
that manifests everything in the universe.
In the beginning there was neither existence
nor non-existence,
All this world was unmanifest energy . . .
The One breathed, without breath, by Its own
power Nothing else was there . . .
 Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda
The first spiritual law of success is the Law of Pure Potentiality.  This law is based on
the fact that we are, in our essential state, pure consciousness. Pure consciousnessis pure potentiality; it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity. Pure con-
sciousness is our spiritual essence. Being infinite and unbounded, it is also pure joy. Other
attributes of consciousness are pure knowledge, infinite silence, perfect balance, invincibility,
simplicity, and bliss. This is our essential nature. Our essential nature is one of pure potentiality.
When you discover your essential nature and know who you really are, in that knowing
itself is  the ability to fulfill any dream you have, because you are the eternal possibility, the
immeasurable potential of all that was, is, and will be. The Law of Pure Potentiality  could also be
called the Law of Unity,  because underlying the infinite diversity of life is the unity of one all-
pervasive spirit. There is no separation between you and this field of energy. The field of purepotentiality is your own Self. And the more you experience your true nature, the closer you areto the field of pure potentiality.
The experience of the Self, or self-referral, means that our internal reference point is our
own spirit, and not the objects of our experience. The opposite of self-referral is object-referral.
In object-referral we are always influenced by objects outside the Self, which include situations,
circumstances, people, and things. In object-referral we are constantly seeking the approval ofothers. Our thinking and our behaviour are always in anticipation of a response. It is thereforefear-based.
In object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for
external power. The need for approval, the need to control things, and the need for external
power are needs that are based on fear. This kind of power is not the power of pure potentiality,or the power of the Self, or real power. When we experience the power of the Self, there is an
absence of fear, there is no compulsion to control, and no struggle for approval or externalpower.
In object-referral, your internal reference point is your ego. The ego, however, is not who
you really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing.Your social mask thrives on approval. It wants to control, and it is sustained by power, becauseit lives in fear.
Your true Self, which is your spirit, your soul, is ^completely free of those things. It is
immune to criticism, it is unfearful of any challenge, and it feels beneath no one. And yet, it is
also humble and feels superior to no one, because it recognizes that everyone else is the sameSelf, the same spirit in different disguises.The law of pure potentiality ¶7Thats the essential difference between object-referral and self-referral. In self-referral, you
experience your true being, which is unfearful of any challenge, has respect for all people, and
feels beneath no one. Self-power is therefore true power.
Power based on object-referral, however, is false power. Being ego-based power, it lasts
only as long as the object of reference is there. If you have a certain title  if youre thepresident of the country or the chairman of a corporation  or if you have a lot of money, thepower you enjoy goes with the title, with the job, with the money. Ego-based power will only
last as long as those things last. As soon as the title, the job, the money go away, so does the
power.
Self-power, on the other hand, is permanent, because it is based on the knowledge of the
Self. And there are certain characteristics of self-power.
It draws people to you, and it also draws things that you want to you. It magnetizes people,
situations, and circumstances to support your desires. This is also called support from the laws
of nature. It is the support of divinity; it is the support that comes from being in the state ofgrace. Your power is such that you enjoy a bond with people, and people enjoy a bond withyou. Your power is that of bonding  a bonding that comes from true love.
How can we apply the Law of Pure Potentiality, the field of all possibilities, to our lives? If
you want to enjoy the benefits of the field of pure potentiality, if you want to make full use of the
creativity which is inherent in pure consciousness, then you have to have access to it. One wayto access the field is through the daily practice of silence, meditation, and non-judgment. Spendingtime in nature will also give you access to the qualities inherent in the field: infinite creativity,freedom, and bliss.
Practicing silence means making a commitment to take a certain amount of time to simply
Be. Experiencing silence means periodically withdrawing from the activity of speech. It also
means periodically withdrawing from such activities as watching television, listening to the ra-dio, or reading a book. If you never give yourself the opportunity to experience silence, thiscreates turbulence in your internal dialogue.
Set aside a little time every once in a while to experience silence. Or simply make a com-
mitment to maintain silence for a certain period each day. You could do it for two hours, or if
that seems a lot, do it for a one-hour period. And every once in a while experience silence foran extended period of time, such as a full day, or two days, or even a whole week.
What happens when you go into this experience of silence? Initially your internal dialogue
becomes even more turbulent. You feel an intense need to say things. Ive known people who
go absolutely crazy the first day or two when they commit themselves to an extended period of
silence. A sense of urgency and anxiety suddenly comes over them. But as they stay with theexperience, their internal dialogue begins to quieten. And soon the silence becomes profound.This is because after a while the mind gives up; it realizes there is no point in going around andaround if you  the Self, the spirit, the choice-maker  are not going to speak, period. Then,
as the internal dialogue quietens, you begin to experience the stillness of the field of pure
potentiality.
Practicing silence periodically as it is convenient to you is one way to experience the Law
of Pure Potentiality.  Spending time each day in meditation is another. Ideally, you should medi-
tate at least thirty minutes in the morning, and thirty minutes in the evening. Through medita-
tion you will learn to experience the field of pure silence and pure awareness. In that field of
pure silence is the field of infinite correlation, the field of infinite organizing power, the ultimateground of creation where everything is inseparably connected with everything else.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶8In the fifth spiritual law, the Law of Intention and Desire,  you will see how you can intro-
duce a faint impulse of intention in this field, and the creation of your desires will come about
spontaneously. But first, you have to experience stillness. Stillness is the first requirement for
manifesting your desires, because in stillness lies your connection to the field of pure potentialitythat can orchestrate an infinity of details for you.
Imagine throwing a little stone into a still pond and watching it ripple. Then, after a while,
when the ripples settle down, perhaps you throw another little stone. Thats exactly what you
do when you go into the field of pure silence and introduce your intention. In this silence, even
the faintest intention will ripple across the underlying ground of universal consciousness, whichconnects everything with everything else. But, if you do not experience stillness in conscious-ness, if your mind is like a turbulent ocean, you could throw the Empire State Building into it,and you wouldnt notice a thing. In the Bible is the expression, Be still, and know that I am
God. This can only be accomplished through meditation.
Another way to access the field of pure potentiality is through the practice of non-judg-
ment. Judgment is the constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When youare constantly evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create a lot of turbulence in yourinternal dialogue. This turbulence constricts the flow of energy between you and the field of
pure potentiality. You literally squeeze the gap between thoughts.
The gap is your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It is that state of pure aware-
ness, that silent space between thoughts, that inner stillness that connects you to true power.And when you squeeze the gap, you squeeze your connection to the field of pure potentialityand infinite creativity.
There is a prayer in A Course in Miracles that states, Today I shall judge nothing that
occurs. Non-judgment creates silence in your mind. It is a good idea, therefore, to begin your
day with that statement. And throughout the day, remind yourself of that statement each timeyou catch yourself judging. If practicing this procedure for the whole day seems too difficult,then you may simply say to yourself, For the next two hours, I wont judge anything, or Forthe next hour, I will experience non-judgment. Then you can extend it gradually.
Through silence, through meditation, and through non-judgment, you will access the first
law, the Law of Pure Potentiality.  Once you start doing that, you can add a fourth component
to this practice, and that is regularly spending time in direct communion with nature. Spendingtime in nature enables you to sense the harmonious interaction of all the elements and forces oflife, and gives you a sense of unity with all of life. Whether it be a stream, a forest, a mountain,
a lake, or the seashore, that connection with natures intelligence will also help you access the
field of pure potentiality.
You must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence
is beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge.It is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment.
Access to your true essence will also give you insight into the mirror of relationship, be-
cause all relationship is a reflection of your relationship with yourself. For example, if you haveguilt, fear, and insecurity over money, or success, or anything else, then these are reflections ofguilt, fear, and insecurity as basic aspects of your personality. No amount of money or successwill solve these basic problems of existence; only intimacy with the Self will bring about true
healing. And when you are grounded in the knowledge of your true Self  when you really
understand your true nature  you will never feel guilty, fearful, or insecure about money, oraffluence, or fulfilling your desires, because you will realize that the essence of all materialwealth is life energy, it is pure potentiality. And pure potentiality is your intrinsic nature.9 The law of pure potentiality¶As you gain more and more access to your true nature, you will also spontaneously receive
creative thoughts, because the field of pure potentiality is also the field of infinite creativity and
pure knowledge. Franz Kafka, the Austrian philosopher and poet, once said, You need not
leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait.You need not even wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary. The world will freelyoffer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.
The affluence of the universe  the lavish display and abundance of the universe  is an
expression of the creative mind of nature. The more tuned in you are to the mind of nature, the
more you have access to its infinite, unbounded creativity. But first, you have to go beyond theturbulence of your internal dialogue to connect with that abundant, affluent, infinite, creativemind. And then you create the possibility of dynamic activity while at the same time carrying thestillness of the eternal, unbounded, creative mind. This exquisite combination of silent, un-
bounded, infinite mind along with dynamic, bounded, individual mind is the perfect balance of
stillness and movement simultaneously that can create whatever you want. This coexistence ofopposites  stillness and dynamism at the same time  makes you independent of situations,circumstances, people, and things.
When you quietly acknowledge this exquisite coexistence of opposites, you align yourself
with the world of energy  the quantum soup, the non-material non-stuff that is the source of
the material world. This world of energy is fluid, dynamic, resilient, changing, forever in motion.And yet it is also non-changing, still, quiet, eternal, and silent.
Stillness alone is the potentiality for creativity; movement alone is creativity restricted to a
certain aspect of its expression. But the combination of movement and stillness enables you tounleash your creativity in all directions  wherever the power of your attention takes you.
Wherever you go in the midst of movement and activity, carry your stillness within you.
Then the chaotic movement around you will never overshadow your access to the reservoir ofcreativity, the field of pure potentiality.
APPLYING THE LAW OF PURE POTENTIALITY
I will put the Law of Pure Potentiality  into effect by making a commitment to take the
following steps:
(1) I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent,
to just Be. I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately
thirty minutes in the morning and thirty minutes in the evening.
(2) I will take time each day to commune with nature and to silently witness the intelli-
gence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to thesound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy ofmy own silence, and by communing with nature, 1 will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the
field of pure potentiality and unbounded creativity.
(3) I will practice non-judgment. I will begin my day with the statement, Today, I shall
judge nothing that occurs, and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶102
The Law of
GivingThe universe operates through dynamic ex-
change... giving and receiving are different aspects
of the flow of energy in the universe.
And in our willingness to give that which we
seek, we keep the abundance of the universe circu-
lating in our lives.
This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again,
and fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of areed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast
breathed through it melodies eternally new. . . . Thy
infinite gifts come to me only on those very small
hands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest,
and still there is room to fill.
 Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali
The second spiritual law of success is the Law of Giving. This law could also be called
the Law of Giving and Receiving,  because the universe operates through dynamic
exchange. Nothing is static. Your body is in dynamic and constant exchange with
the body of the universe; your mind is dynamically interacting with the mind of the cosmos; yourenergy is an expression of cosmic energy.
The flow of life is nothing other than the harmonious interaction of all the elements and
forces that structure the field of existence. This harmonious interaction of elements and forces
in your life operates as the Law of Giving.  Because your body and your mind and the universe
are in constant and dynamic exchange, stopping the circulation of energy is like stopping theflow of blood. Whenever blood stops flowing, it begins to clot, to coagulate, to stagnate. That iswhy you must give and receive in order to keep wealth and affluence  or anything you want inlife  circulating in your life.
The word affluence comes from the root word affluere, which means to flow to. The
word affluence means to flow in abundance. Money is really a symbol of the life energy weexchange and the life energy we use as a result of the service we provide to the universe.Another word for money is currency, which also reflects the flowing nature of energy. Theword currency comes from the Latin word currere which means to run or to flow.
Therefore, if we stop the circulation of money  if our only intention is to hold on to our
money and hoard it  since it is life energy, we will stop its circulation back into our lives aswell. In order to keep that energy coming to us, we have to keep the energy circulating. Like ariver, money must keep flowing, otherwise it begins to stagnate, to clog, to suffocate and stran-gle its very own life force. Circulation keeps it alive and vital.
Every relationship is one of give and take. Giving engenders receiving, and receiving en-
genders giving. What goes up must come down; what goes out must come back. In reality,receiving is the same thing as giving, because giving and receiving are different aspects of theflow of energy in the universe. And if you stop the flow of either, you interfere with naturesintelligence.
In every seed is the promise of thousands of forests. But the seed must not be hoarded; it
must give its intelligence to the fertile ground. Through its giving, its unseen energy flows intomaterial manifestation.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶12The more you give, the more you will receive, because you will keep the abundance of the
universe circulating in your life. In fact, anything that is of value in life only multiplies when it is
given. That which doesnt multiply through giving is neither worth giving nor worth receiving. If,
through the act of giving, you feel you have lost something, then the gift is not truly given andwill not cause increase. If you give grudgingly, there is no energy behind that giving.
It is the intention behind your giving and receiving that is the most important thing. The
intention should always be to create happiness for the giver and receiver, because happiness is
life-supporting and life-sustaining and therefore generates increase. The return is directly pro-
portional to the giving when it is unconditional and from the heart. That is why the act of givinghas to be joyful  the frame of mind has to be one in which you feel joy in the very act of  giving.
Then the energy behind the giving increases many times over.
Practicing the Law of Giving  is actually very simple: if you want joy, give joy to others; if
you want love, learn to give love; if you want attention and appreciation, learn to give attention
and appreciation; if you want material affluence, help others to become materially affluent. Infact, the easiest way to get what you want is to help others get what they want. This principleworks equally well for individuals, corporations, societies, and nations. If you want to be blessedwith all the good things in life, learn to silently bless everyone with all the good things in life.
Even the thought of giving, the thought of blessing, or a simple prayer  has the power to
affect others. This is because our body, reduced to its essential state, is a localized bundle ofenergy and information in a universe of energy and information. We are localized bundles ofconsciousness in a conscious universe. The word consciousness implies more than just energyand information  it implies energy and information which is alive as thought. Therefore weare bundles of thought in a thinking universe. And thought has the power to transform.
Life is the eternal dance of consciousness that expresses itself as the dynamic exchange of
impulses of intelligence between microcosm and macrocosm, between the human body and theuniversal body, between the human mind and the cosmic mind.
When you learn to give that which you seek, you activate and choreograph the dance with
an exquisite, energetic, and vital movement that constitutes the eternal throb of life.
The best way to put the Law of Giving  into operation  to start the whole process of
circulation  is to make a decision that any time you come into contact with anyone, you willgive them something. It doesnt have to be in the form of material things; it could be a flower, acompliment, or a prayer. In fact, the most powerful forms of giving are non-material. The giftsof caring, attention, affection, appreciation, and love are some of the most precious gifts you
can give, and they dont cost you anything.
When you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness,
joy, and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful.
One of the things I was taught as a child, and which I taught my children also, is never to go
to anyones house without bringing something  never visit anyone without bringing them a
gift. You may say, How can I give to others when at the moment I dont have enough myself?
You can bring a flower. One flower. You can bring a note or a card which says something aboutyour feelings for the person youre visiting. You can bring a compliment. You can bring aprayer.
Make a decision to give wherever you go, to whomever you see. As long as youre giving,
you will be receiving. The more you give, the more confidence you will gain in the miraculous
effects of this law. And as you receive more, your ability to give more will also increase.
Our true nature is one of affluence and abundance; we are naturally affluent because nature
supports every need and desire. We lack nothing, because our essential nature is one of pure13 The law of Giving¶potentiality and infinite possibilities. Therefore, you must know that you are already inherently
affluent, no matter how much or how little money you have, because the source of all wealth is
the field of pure potentiality  it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need,
including joy, love, laughter, peace, harmony, and knowledge. If you seek these things first not only for yourself, but for others  all else will come to you spontaneously.
APPLYING THE LAW OF GIVING
I will put the Law of  Giving into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
(1) Wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will bring them a gift. The gift may be a
compliment, a flower, or a prayer. Today, I will give something to everyone I come intocontact with, and so I will begin the process of circulating joy, wealth and affluence inmy life and in the lives of others.
(2) Today I will gratefully receive all the gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gifts
of nature: sunlight and the sound of birds singing, or spring showers or the first snow
of winter. I will also be open to receiving from others, whether it be in the form of a
material gift, money, a compliment, or a prayer.
(3) I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving
lifes most precious gifts: the gifts of caring, affection, appreciation, and love. Eachtime I meet someone, I will silently wish them happiness, joy, and laughter.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶143
The law
of karma
or cause
and effectEvery action generates a force of energy that
returns to us in like kind . . . what we sow is what we
reap.
And when we choose actions that bring happi-
ness and success to others, the fruit of our karma is
happiness and success.
Karma is the eternal assertion of human free-
dom. . . . Our thoughts, our words, and deeds arethe threads of the net which we throw around our-
selves.
 Swami Vivekananda
The third spiritual law of success is the Law of Karma.  Karma is both action and the
consequence of that action; it is cause and effect simultaneously, because every
action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind. There is nothing
unfamiliar about the Law of  Karma. Everyone has heard the expression, What you sow is what
you reap. Obviously, if we want to create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow theseeds of happiness. Therefore, karma implies the action of conscious choice-making.
You and I are essentially infinite choice-makers. In every moment of our existence, we are
in that field of all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices. Some of these
choices are made consciously, while others are made unconsciously. But the best way to under-stand and maximize the use of karmic law is to become consciously aware of the choices wemake in every moment.
Whether you like it or not, everything that is happening at this moment is a result of the
choices youve made in the past. Unfortunately, a lot of us make choices unconsciously, and
therefore we dont think they are choices  and yet, they are.
If I were to insult you, you would most likely make the choice of being offended. If I were to
pay you a compliment, you would most likely make the choice of being pleased or flattered. Butthink about it: its still a choice.
I could offend you and I could insult you, and you could make the choice of not being
offended. I could pay you a compliment and you could make the choice of not letting that flatter
you either.
In other words, most of us  even though we are infinite choice-makers  have become
bundles of conditioned reflexes that are constantly being triggered by people and circumstancesinto predictable outcomes of behaviour. These conditioned reflexes are like Pavlovian condi-
tioning. Pavlov is famous for demonstrating that if you give a dog something to eat every time
you ring a bell, soon the dog starts to salivate when you just ring the bell, because it hasassociated one stimulus with the other.
Most of us, as a result of conditioning, have repetitions and predictable responses to the
stimuli in our environment. Our reactions seem to be automatically triggered by people and
circumstances, and we forget that these are still choices that we are making in every moment of
our existence. We are simply making these choices unconsciously.
If you step back for a moment and witness the choices you are making as you make those
choices, then in just this act of witnessing, you take the whole process from the unconsciousThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶16realm into the conscious realm. This procedure of conscious choice-making and witnessing is
very empowering.
When you make any choice  any choice at all  you can ask yourself two things: First of
all, What are the consequences of this choice that Im making? In your heart you will immedi-ately know what these are. Secondly, Will this choice that Im making now bring happiness tome and to those around me? If the answer is yes, then go ahead with that choice. If the answeris no, if that choice brings distress either to you or to those around you, then dont make that
choice. Its as simple as that.
There is only one choice, out of the infinity of choices available in every second, that will
create happiness for you as well as for those around you. And when you make that one choice,it will result in a form of behaviour that is called spontaneous right action. Spontaneous rightaction is the right action at the right moment. Its the right response to every situation as it
happens. Its the action that nourishes you and everyone else who is influenced by that action.
There is a very interesting mechanism that the universe has to help you make spontane-
ously correct choices. The mechanism has to do with sensations in your body. Your bodyexperiences two kinds of sensations: one is a sensation of comfort, the other is a sensation ofdiscomfort. At the moment you consciously make a choice, pay attention to your body and ask
your body, If I make this choice, what happens? If your body sends a message of comfort,
thats the right choice. If your body sends a message of discomfort, then its not the appropriatechoice.
For some people the message of comfort and discomfort is in the area of the solar plexus,
but for most people its in the area of the heart. Consciously put your attention in the heart andask your heart what to do. Then wait for the response  a physical response in the form of a
sensation. It may be the .faintest level of feeling  but its there, in your body.
Only the heart knows the correct answer. Most people think the heart is mushy and senti-
mental. But its not. The heart is intuitive; its holistic, its contextual, its relational. It doesnthave a win-lose orientation. It taps into the cosmic computer  the field of pure potentiality,pure knowledge, and infinite organizing power  and takes everything into account. At times it
may not even seem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurate and
far more precise than anything within the limits of rational thought.
You can use the Law of Karma  to create money and affluence, and the flow of all good
things to you, any time you want. But first, you must become consciously aware that your futureis generated by the choices you are making in every moment of your life. If you do this on a
regular basis, then you are making full use of the Law of Karma.  The more you bring your
choices into the level of your conscious awareness, the more you will make those choices whichare spontaneously correct  both for you and those around you.
What about past karma and how it is influencing you now? There are three things you can
do about past karma. One is to pay your karmic debts. Most people choose to do that 
unconsciously, of course. This may be a choice you make, also. Sometimes theres a lot of
suffering involved in the payment of those debts, but the Law of Karma  says no debt in the
universe ever goes unpaid. There is a perfect accounting system in this universe, and everythingis a constant to and fro exchange of energy.
The second thing you can do is to transmute or transform your karma to a more desirable
experience. This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself, as youre paying your
karmic debt, What can I learn from this experience? Why is this happening and what is themessage that the universe is giving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellowhuman beings?17 The law of Carma or Cause and Effect¶By doing this, you look for the seed of opportunity and then tie that seed of opportunity
with your dharma,  with your purpose in life, which well talk about in the Seventh Spiritual Law
of Success. This allows you to transmute the karma to a new expression.
For example, if you break your leg while playing sports, you might ask, What can I learn
from this experience? What is the message that the universe is giving me? Perhaps the mes-sage is that you need to slow down and be more careful or attentive to your body the next time.And if your dharma is to teach others what you know, then by asking, How can I make this
experience useful to my fellow human beings? you may decide to share what you learned by
writing a book about playing sports safely. Or you may design a special shoe or leg support thatprevents the kind of injury you experienced.
This way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted the adversity into a
benefit that may bring you wealth and fulfillment. This is the transmutation of your karma into
a positive experience. You havent really gotten rid of your kar ma, but you are able to take a
karmic episode and create a new and positive karma out of it.
The third way to deal with karma is to transcend it. To transcend karma is to become
independent of it. The way to transcend karma is to keep experiencing the gap, the Self, theSpirit. Its like washing a dirty piece of cloth in a stream of water. Every time you wash it, you
take away a few stains. You keep washing it again and again, and each time it gets a little
cleaner. You wash or transcend the seeds of your karma by going into the gap and coming outagain. This, of course, is done through the practice of meditation.
All actions are karmic episodes. Drinking a cup of coffee is a karmic episode. That action
generates memory, and memory has the ability or the potentiality to generate desire. Anddesire generates action again. The operational software of your soul is karma, memory, and
desire. Your soul is a bundle of consciousness that has the seeds of karma, memory, and desire.
By becoming conscious of these seeds of manifestation, you become a conscious generator ofreality. By becoming a conscious choice-maker, you begin to generate actions that are evolu-tionary for you and for those that are around you. And thats all you need to do.
As long as karma is evolutionary  for both the Self and everyone affected by the Self 
then the fruit of karma will be happiness and success.
APPLYING THE LAW OF KARMA OR CAUSE AND EFFECT
I will put the Law of Karma  into effect by making a commitment to take the following
steps:
(1) Today I will witness the choices I make in each moment. And in the mere witnessing of
these choices, I will bring them to my conscious awareness. I will know that the best
way to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.
(2) Whenever I make a choice, I will ask myself two questions: What are the conse-
quences of this choice that Im making? and Will this choice bring fulfillment andhappiness to me and also to those who are affected by this choice?
(3) I will then ask my heart for guidance and be guided by its message of comfort or
discomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon. If thechoice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with
my inner vision. This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices
for myself and for all those around me.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶184
The law of least
effortNature 5 intelligence functions with effortless
ease . . . with carefreeness, harmony, and love.
And when we harness the forces of harmony,
joy, and love, we create success and good fortune
with effortless ease.
An integral being knows without going, sees
without looking, and accomplishes without doing.
 Lao T ZU
The fourth spiritual law of success is the Law of Least Effort.  This law is based on the
fact that natures intelligence functions with effortless ease and abandoned carefulness. This is the principle of least action, of no resistance. This is, therefore, the
principle of harmony and love. When we learn this lesson from nature, we easily fulfill ourdesires.
If you observe nature at work, you will see that least effort is expended. Grass doesnt try to
grow, it just grows. Fish dont try to swim, they just swim. Flowers dont try to bloom, they
bloom. Birds dont try to fly, they fly. This is their intrinsic nture. The earth doesnt try to spinon its own axis; it is the nature of the earth to spin with dizzying speed and to hurtle throughspace. It is the nature of babies to be in bliss. It is the nature of the sun to shine. It is the natureof the stars to glitter and sparkle. And it is human nature to make our dreams manifest into
physical form, easily and effortlessly.
In Vedic Science, the age-old philosophy of India, this principle is known as the principle of
economy of effort, or do less and accomplish more. Ultimately you come to the state whereyou do nothing and accomplish everything. This means that there is just a faint idea, and thenthe manifestation of the idea comes about effortlessly. What is commonly called a miracle isactually an expression of the Law of Least Effort.
Natures intelligence functions effortlessly, fric-tionlessly, spontaneously. It is non-linear; it
is intuitive, holistic, and nourishing. And when you are in harmony with nature, when you areestablished in the knowledge of your true self, you can make use or the Law of Least Effort.
Least effort is expended when your actions are motivated by love, because nature is held
together by the energy of love. When you seek power and control over other people, you wasteenergy. When you seek money or power for the sake of the ego, you spend energy chasing theillusion of happiness instead of enjoying happiness in the moment. When you seek money forpersonal gain only, you cut off the flow of energy to yourself, and interfere with the expressionof natures intelligence. But when your actions are motivated by love, there is no waste ofenergy. When your actions are motivated by love, your energy multiplies and accumulates and the surplus energy you gather and enjoy can be channeled to create anything that you want,including unlimited wealth.
You can think of your physical body as a device for controlling energy: it can generate,
store, and expend energy. If you know how to generate, store, and expend energy in an effi-cient way, then you can create any amount of wealth. Attention to the ego consumes thegreatest amount of energy. When your internal reference point is the ego, when you seekpower and control over other people or seek approval from others, you spend energy in awasteful way.
When that energy is freed up, it can be rechanneled and used to create anything that you
want. When your internal reference point is your spirit, when you are immune to criticism and
unfearful of any challenge, you can harness the power of love, and use energy creatively for the
experience of affluence and evolution.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶20In The Art of Dreaming,  Don Juan tells Carlos Castaneda, . . . most of our energy goes
into upholding our importance. ... If we were capable of losing some of that importance, two
extraordinary things would happen to us: One, we would free our energy from trying to main-
tain the illusory idea of our grandeur; and two, we would provide ourselves with enough energyto catch a glimpse or the actual grandeur of the universe.
There are three components to the Law of Least Effort   three things you can do to put
this principle of do less and accomplish more into action. The first component is acceptance.Acceptance simply means that you make a commitment: Today I will accept people, situa-tions, circumstances, and events as they occur. This means I will know that this moment is as
it should be,  because the whole universe is as it should be. This moment  the one youre
experiencing right now  is the culmination of all the moments you have experienced in thepast. This moment is as it is because the entire universe is as it is.
When you struggle against this moment, youre actually struggling against the entire uni-
verse. Instead, you can make the decision that today you will not struggle against the wholeuniverse by struggling against this moment. 1 his means that your acceptance  of this moment is
total and complete. You accept things as they are, not as you wish they were in this moment.
This is important to understand. You can wish for things in the future to be different, but in this
moment you have to accept things as they are.
When you feel frustrated or upset by a person or a situation, remember that you are not
reacting to the person or the situation, but to your feelings about the person or the situation.These are your feelings, and your feelings are not someone elses fault. When you recognize
and understand this completely, you are ready to take responsibility for how you feel and tochange it. And if you can accept things as they are, you are ready to take responsibility for yoursituation and for all the events you see as problems.
This leads us to the second component of the Law of Least Effort:  responsibility. What
does responsibility mean? Responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for your situa-tion, including yourself. Having accepted this circumstance, this event, this problem, responsi-bility then means the ability  to have a creative response to the situation as it is now.  All prob-
lems contain the seeds of opportunity, and this awareness allows you to take the moment andtransform it to a better situation or thing.
Once you do this, every so-called upsetting situation will become an opportunity for the
creation of something new and beautiful, and every so-called tormentor or tyrant will becomeyour teacher. Reality is an interpretation. And if you choose to interpret reality in this way, youwill have many teachers around you, and many opportunities to evolve.
Whenever confronted by a tyrant, tormentor, teacher, friend, or foe (they all mean the
same thing) remind yourself, This moment is as it should be. Whatever relationships you haveattracted in your life at this moment are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment.There is a hidden meaning behind all events, and this hidden meaning is serving your ownevolution.
The third component of the Law of Least Effort  is defencelessness, which means that your
awareness is established in defenselessness, and you have relinquished the need to convince orpersuade others of your point of view. If you observe people around you, youll see that theyspend ninety-nine percent of their time defending their points of view. If you just relinquish theneed to defend your point of view, you will in that relinquishment, gain access to enormousamounts of energy that have been previously wasted.
When you become defensive, blame others, and do not accept and surrender to the mo-
ment, your life meets resistance. Any time you encounter resistance, recognize that if you forcethe situation, the resistance will only increase. You dont want to stand rigid like a tall oak thatcracks and collapses in the storm. Instead, you want to be flexible, like a reed that bends withthe storm and survives.
Completely desist from defending your point of view. When you have no point to defend,
you do not allow the birth of an argument. If you do this consistently  if you stop fighting and21 The law of least effort
¶resisting  you will fully experience the present, which is a gift. Someone once told me, The
past is history, the future is a mystery, and this moment is a gift. That is why this moment is
called the present.
If you embrace the present and become one with it, and merge with it, you will experience
a fire, a glow, a sparkle of ecstasy throbbing in every living sentient being. As you begin toexperience this exultation of spirit in everything that is alive, as you become intimate with it, joywill be born within you, and you will drop the terrible burdens and encumbrances of defensive-
ness, resentment, and hurtfulness. Only then will you become light-hearted, carefree, joyous,
and free.
In this joyful, simple freedom, you will know without any doubt in your heart that what you
want is available to you whenever you want it, because your want will be from the level ofhappiness, not from the level of anxiety or fear. You do not need to justify; simply declare your
intent to yourself, and you will experience fulfillment, delight, joy, freedom, and autonomy in
every moment of your life.
Make a commitment to follow the path of no resistance. This is the path through which
natures intelligence unfolds spontaneously, without friction or effort. When you have the exqui-site combination of acceptance, responsibility, and defenselessness, you will experience life
flowing with effortless ease.
When you remain open to all points of view  not rigidly attached to only one  your
dreams and desires will flow with natures desires. Then you can release your intentions, with-out attachment, and just wait for the appropriate season for your desires to blossom into reality.You can be sure that when the season is right, your desires will manifest. This is the Law of
Least Effort.
APPLYING THE LAW OF LEAST EFFORT
I will put the Law of Least Effort  into effect by making a commitment to take the following
steps:
(1) I will practice Acceptance.  Today I will accept people, situations, circumstances, and
events as they occur. I will know that this moment is as it should be,  because the whole
universe is as it should be. I will not struggle against the whole universe by struggling
against this moment. My acceptance is total and complete. I accept things as they arethis moment, not as I wish they were.
(2) Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility  for my situation and for
all those events I see as problems. I know that taking responsibility means not blaminganyone or anything for my situation (and this includes myself). I also know that everyproblem is an opportunity in disguise, and this alertness to opportunities allows me to
take this moment and transform it into a greater benefit.
(3) Today my awareness will remain established in Defenselessness.  I will relinquish the
need to defend my point of view. I will feel no need to convince or persuade others toaccept my point of view. I will remain open to all points of view and not be rigidlyattached to any one of them.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶225
THE LAW  of
INTENTION  and
DESIREInherent in every intention and desire is the
mechanics for its fulfillment. . . intention and desire
in the field of pure potentiality have infinite organiz-ing power.
And when we introduce an intention in the fer-
tile ground of pure potentiality, we put this infinite
organiyng power to work for us.
In the beginning there was desire, which was
the first seed of mind; sages, having meditated in
their hearts, have discovered by their wisdom the
connection of the existent with the non-existent.
 The Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda
The fifth spiritual law of success is the Law of Intention and Desire.  This law is based
on the fact that energy and information exist everywhere in nature. In fact, at thelevel of the quantum field, there is nothing other than energy and information. The
quantum field is just another label for the field of pure consciousness or pure potentiality. And
this quantum field is influenced by intention and desire. Lets examine this process in detail.
A flower, a rainbow, a tree, a blade of grass, a human body, when broken down to their
essential components, are energy and information. The whole universe, in its essential nature,is the movement  of energy and information. The only difference between you and a tree is the
informational and energy content of your respective bodies.
On the material level, both you and the tree are made up of the same recycled elements:
mostly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements in minute amounts. You could
buy these elements in a hardware store for a couple of dollars. The difference, therefore, be-tween you and the tree is not the carbon, or the hydrogen, or the oxygen. In fact; you and thetree are constantly exchanging your carbon and oxygen with each other. The real differencebetween the two of you is in the energy and in the information.
In the scheme of nature, you and I are a privileged species. We have a nervous system that
is capable of becoming aware of  the energy and informational content of that localized field that
gives rise to our physical body. We  experience  this field subjectively as our own thoughts,
feelings, emotions, desires, memories, instincts, drives, and beliefs. This same field is experi-enced objectively as the physical body  and through the physical body, we experience this
field as the world. But its all the same stuff. That is why the ancient seers exclaimed, I am that,
you are that, all this is that, and thats all there is.
Your body is not separate from the body of the universe, because at quantum mechanical
levels there are no well-defined edges. You are like a wiggle, a wave, a fluctuation, a convolu-tion, a whirlpool, a localized disturbance in the larger quantum field. The larger quantum field
 the universe  is your extended body.
Not only is the human nervous system capable of becoming aware of the information and
energy of its own quantum field, but because human consciousness is infinitely flexible throughthis wonderful nervous system, you are able to consciously change the informational contentthat gives rise to your physical body. You can consciously change the energy and informational
content or your own quantum mechanical body, and therefore influence the energy and infor-The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶24mational content of your extended body  your environment, your world  and cause things
to manifest in it.
This conscious change is brought about by the two qualities inherent in consciousness:
attention and intention. Attention energizes, and intention transforms. Whatever you put yourattention on will grow stronger in your life. Whatever you take your attention away from willwither, disintegrate, and disappear. Intention, on the other hand, triggers transformation ofenergy and information. Intention organizes its own fulfillment.
The quality of intention on the object of attention will orchestrate an infinity of space-time
events to bring about the outcome intended, provided one follows the other spiritual laws ofsuccess. This is because intention in the fertile ground of attention has infinite organizing power.Infinite organizing power means the power to organize an infinity of space-time events, all atthe same time. We see the expression of this infinite organizing power in every blade of grass,
in every apple blossom, in every cell of our body. We see it in everything that is alive.
In the scheme of nature, everything correlates and connects with everything else. The
groundhog comes out of the earth and you know it is going to be spring. Birds begin to migratein a certain direction at a certain time of the year. Nature is a symphony. And that symphony isbeing silently orchestrated at the ultimate ground of creation.
The human body is another good example of this symphony. A single cell in the human
body is doing about six trillion things per second, and it has to know what every other cell isdoing at the same time. The human body can play music, kill germs, make a baby, recite poetry,and monitor the movement of stars all at the same time, because the field of infinite correlationis part of its information field.
What is remarkable about the nervous system of the human species is that it can command
this infinite organizing power through conscious intent. Intent in the human species is not fixed
or locked into a rigid network of energy and information. It has infinite flexibility. In otherwords, as long as you do not violate the other laws of nature, through your intent you canliterally command the laws of nature to fulfill your dreams and desires.
You can put the cosmic computer with its infinite organizing power to work for you. You
can go to that ultimate ground of creation and introduce an intention, and just by introducing
the intention, you activate the field of infinite correlation.
Intention lays the groundwork for the effortless, spontaneous, frictionless flow of pure
potentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest to the manifest. The only caution is thatyou use your intent for the benefit of mankind. This happens spontaneously when you are in
alignment with The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.
Intention is the real power behind desire. Intent alone is very powerful, because intent is
desire without attachment to the outcome. Desire alone is weak, because desire in most peopleis attention with attachment. Intent is desire with strict adherence to all the other laws, butparticularly the Law of Detachment,  which is the Sixth Spiritual Law of Success.
Intention combined with detachment leads to life-centered, present-moment awareness.
And when action is performed in present-moment awareness, it is most effective. Y our intent  is
for the future, but your attention  is in the present. As long as your attention is in the present,
then your intent for the future will manifest, because the future is created in the present. Youmust accept the present as is. Accept the present and intend the future. The future is something
you can always create through detached intention, but you should never struggle against the
present.25 The law of Intention and Desire¶The past, present, and future are all properties of consciousness. The past is recollection,
memory; the future is anticipation; the present is awareness. Therefore time is the movement
of thought. Both past and future are born in the imagination; only the present, which is aware-
ness, is real and eternal. It is. It is the potentiality for space-time, matter, and energy. It is aneternal field of possibilities experiencing itself as abstract forces, whether they be light, heat,electricity, magnetism, or gravity. These forces are neither in the past nor in the future. Theyjust are.
Our interpretation of these abstract forces gives us the experience of concrete phenomena
and form. Remembered interpretations of abstract forces create the experience of the past,anticipatory interpretations of the same abstract forces create the future. They are the qualitiesof attention in consciousness. When these qualities are freed from the burden of the past, thenaction in the present becomes the fertile ground for the creation of the future.
Intention, grounded in this detached freedom of the present, serves as the catalyst for the
right mix of matter, energy, and space-time events to create whatever it is that you desire.
If you have life-centered, present-moment awareness, then the imaginary obstacles 
which are more than ninety percent of perceived obstacles  disintegrate and disappear. Theremaining five to ten percent of perceived obstacles can be transmuted into opportunities through
one-pointed intention.
One-pointed intention is that quality of attention that is unbending in its fixity of purpose.
One-pointed intention means holding your attention to the intended outcome with such un-bending purpose that you absolutely refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate thefocused quality of your attention. There is a total and complete exclusion of all obstacles fromyour consciousness. You are able to maintain an unshakable serenity while being committed to
your goal with intense passion. This is the power of detached awareness and one-pointed,
focused intention simultaneously.
Learn to harness the power of intention, and you can create anything you desire. You can
still get results through effort and through trying, but at a cost. The cost is stress, heart attacks,and the compromised function of your immune system. It is much better to execute the follow-
ing five steps in the Law of  Intention and Desire.  When you follow these five steps for fulfilling
your desires, intention generates its own power:
(1) Slip into the gap. This means to center yourself in that silent space between thoughts,
to go into the silence  that level of Being which is your essential state.
(2) Established in that state of Being, release your intentions and desires. When you are
actually in the gap, theres no thought, theres no intention, but as you come out of the
gap  at that junction between the gap and a thought  you introduce the intention.If you have a series of goals, you can write them down, and have your intentionfocused on them before you go into the gap. If you want a successful career, forexample, you go into the gap with that intention, and the intention will already be
there as a faint flicker in your awareness. Releasing your intentions and desires in the
gap means planting them in the fertile ground of pure potentiality, and expecting themto bloom when the season is right. You do not want to dig up the seeds of your desiresto see if they are growing, or get rigidly attached to the way in which they will unfold.You simply want to release them.
(3) Remain in the state of self-referral. This means remain established in the awareness of
your true Self  your spirit, your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It alsoThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶26means not to look at yourself through the eyes of the world, or allow yourself to be
influenced by the opinions and criticisms of others. A helpful way to maintain that
state of self-referral is to keep your desires to yourself; do not share them with anyone
else unless they share the exact same desires that you have and are closely bondedwith you.
(4) Relinquish your attachment to the outcome. This means giving up your rigid attach-
ment to a specific result and living in the wisdom of uncertainty. It means enjoyingevery moment in the journey of your life, even if you dont know the outcome.
(5) Let the universe handle the details. Your intentions and desires, when released in the
gap, have infinite organizing power. Trust that infinite organizing power of intention
to orchestrate all the details for you.
Remember that your true nature is one of pure spirit. Carry the consciousness of your spirit
wherever you go, gently release your desires, and the universe will handle the details for you.
APPLYING THE LAW OF INTENTION AND DESIRE
I will put the Law of Intention and Desire  into effect by making a commitment to take the
following steps:
(1) I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with me wherever I go. I will look
at this list before I go into my silence and meditation. I will look at it before I go to sleep
at night. I will look at it when I wake up in the morning.
(2) I will release this list of my desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting
that when things dont seem to go my way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic planhas designs for me much grander than even those that I have conceived.
(3) I will remind myself to practice present-moment awareness in all my actions. I will
refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of my attention in thepresent moment. I will accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through my
deepest, most cherished intentions and desires.27 The law of Intention and Desire¶6
THE LAW  of
DETACHMENTIn detachment lies the wisdom of uncertainty,
in the wisdom of uncertainty lies the freedom from
our past, from the known, which is the prison ofpast conditioning.
And in our willingness to step into the unknown,
the field of all possibilities, we surrender ourselves to
the creative mind that orchestrates the dance of the
universe.
Like two golden birds perched on the selfsame
tree, intimate friends, the ego and the Self dwell in
the same body. The former eats the sweet and sour
fruits of the tree of life, while the latter looks on in
detachment.
 The Mundaka Upanishad
The sixth spiritual law of success is the Law of Detachment.  The Law of Detachment
says that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquishyour attachment to it. This doesnt mean you give up the intention to create your
desire. You dont give up the intention, and you dont give up the desire. You give up your
attachment to the result.
This a very powerful thing to do. The moment you relinquish your attachment to the result,
combining one-pointed intention with detachment at the same time, you will have that whichyou desire. Anything you want can be acquired through detachment, because detachment isbased on the unquestioning belief in the power of your true Self.
Attachment, on the other hand, is based on fear and insecurity  and the need for security
is based on not knowing the true Self. The source of wealth, of abundance, or of anything in thephysical world is the Self; it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need. Everythingelse is a symbol: cars, houses, bank notes, clothes, airplanes. Symbols are transitory; they comeand go. Chasing symbols is like settling for the map instead of the territory. It creates anxiety; it
ends up making you feel hollow and empty inside, because you exchange your Self for the
symbols of your Self.
Attachment comes from poverty consciousness, because attachment is always to symbols.
Detachment is synonymous with wealth consciousness, because with detachment there is free-dom to create. Only from detached involvement can one have joy and laughter. Then the
symbols of wealth are created spontaneously and effortlessly. Without detachment we are pris-
oners of helplessness, hopelessness, mundane needs, trivial concerns, quiet desperation, andseriousness  the distinctive features of everyday mediocre existence and poverty conscious-ness.
True wealth consciousness is the ability to have anything you want, anytime you want, and
with least effort. To be grounded in this experience you have to be grounded in the wisdom of
uncertainty. In this uncertainty you will find the freedom to create anything you want.
People are constantly seeking security, and you will find that seeking security is actually a
very ephemeral thing. Even attachment to money is a sign of insecurity. You might say, WhenI have X million dollars, then Ill be secure. Then Ill be financially independent and I will retire.
Then I will do all the things I really want to do. But it never happens  never  happens.29 The law of pure Detachment¶Those who seek security chase it for a lifetime without ever finding it. it remains elusive and
ephemeral, because security can never come from money alone. Attachment to money will
always create insecurity no matter how much money you have in the bank. In fact, some of the
people who have the most money are the most insecure.
The search for security is an illusion. In ancient wisdom traditions, the solution to this
whole dilemma lies in the wisdom of insecurity, or the wisdom of uncertainty. This means thatthe search for security and certainty is actually an attachment  to the known. And whats the
known? The known is our past. The known is nothing other than the prison of past con-
ditioning. Theres no evolution in that  absolutely none at all. And when there is no evolution,there is stagnation, entropy, disorder, and decay.
Uncertainty, on the other hand, is the fertile ground of pure creativity and freedom. Uncer-
tainty means stepping into the unknown in every moment of our existence. The unknown is the
field of all possibilities, ever fresh, ever new, always open to the creation ot new manifestations.
Without uncertainty and the unknown, life is just the stale repetition of outworn memories. Youbecome the victim of the past, and your tormentor today is your self left over from yesterday.
Relinquish your attachment to the known, step into the unknown, and you will step into the
field of all possibilities. In your willingness to step into the unknown, you will have the wisdom
of uncertainty factored in. This means that in every moment of your life, you will have excite-
ment, adventure, mystery. You will experience the fun of life  the magic, the celebration, theexhilaration, and the exultation of your own spirit.
Every day you can look for the excitement of what may occur in the field of all possibilities.
When you experience uncertainty, you are on the right path  so dont give it up. You dontneed to have a complete and rigid idea of what youll be doing next week or next year, because
if you have a very clear idea of whats going to happen and you get rigidly attached to it, then
you shut out a whole range of possibilities.
One characteristic of the field of all possibilities is infinite correlation. The field can orches-
trate an infinity of space-time events to bring about the outcome that is intended. But when youare attached, your intention gets locked into a rigid mindset and you lose the fluidity, the crea-
tivity, and the spontaneity inherent in the field. When you get attached, you freeze your desire
from that infinite fluidity and flexibility into a rigid framework which interferes with the wholeprocess of creation.
The Law of Detachment  does not interfere with the Law of  Intention and Desire   with
goal-setting. You still have the intention of going in a certain direction, you still have a goal.
However, between point A and point B there are infinite possibilities. With uncertainty factored
in, you might change direction in any moment if you find a higher ideal, or if you find somethingmore exciting. You are also less likely to force solutions on problems, which enables you to stayalert to opportunities.
The Law of Detachment  accelerates the whole process of evolution. When you understand
this law, you dont feel compelled to force solutions. When you force solutions on problems,
you only create new problems. But when you put your attention on the uncertainty, and youwitness the uncertainty while you expectantly wait for the solution to emerge out of the chaosand the confusion, then what emerges is something very fabulous and exciting.
This state of alertness  your preparedness in the present, in the field of uncertainty 
meets with your goal and your intention and allows you to seize the opportunity. Whats the
opportunity? Its contained within every problem that you have in your life. Every single prob-lem that you have in your life is the seed of an opportunity for some greater benefit. Once youThe Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶30have that perception, you open up to a whole range of possibilities  and this keeps the
mystery, the wonder, the excitement, the adventure alive.
You can look at every problem you have in your life as an opportunity for some greater
benefit. You can stay alert to opportunities by being grounded in the wisdom of uncertainty.When your preparedness meets opportunity, the solution will spontaneously appear.
What comes out of that is often called good luck. Good luck is nothing but preparedness
and opportunity coming together. When the two are mixed together with an alert witnessing of
the chaos, a solution emerges that will be of evolutionary benefit to you and to all those that you
come into contact with. This is the perfect recipe for success, and it is based on the Law of
Detachment.
APPLYING THE LAW OF DETACHMENT
I will put the Law of Detachment  into effect by making a commitment to take the following
steps:
(1) Today I will commit myself to detachment. 1 will allow myself and those around me the
freedom to be as they are. I will not rigidly impose my idea of how things should be. I
will not force solutions on problems, thereby creating new problems. I will participatein everything with detached involvement.
(2) Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingredient of my experience. In my
willingness to accept uncertainty, solutions will spontaneously emerge out of the prob-lem, out of the confusion, disorder, and chaos. The more uncertain things seem to be,the more secure I will feel, because uncertainty is my path to freedom. Through the
wisdom of uncertainty, I will find my security.
(3) I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate the excitement that can occur
when I remain open to an infinity of choices. When I step into the field of all possibili-ties, I will experience all the fun, adventure, magic, and mystery of life.31 The law of Detachment¶7
The law of
dharma or
purpose in lifeEveryone has a purpose in life ... a unique gift
or special talent to give to others.
And when we blend this unique talent with ser-
vice to others, we experience the ecstasy and exulta-
tion of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of
all goals.
When you work you are a flute through whose
heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.And what is it to work with love
. It is to weave the
cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if
your beloved were to wear that cloth. . . .
 Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet
The seventh spiritual law of success is the Law of Dharma.  Dharma is a Sanskrit word
that means purpose in life. The Law of Dharma  says that we have taken manifes
tation in physical form to fulfill a purpose. The field of pure potentiality is divinity in
its essence, and the divine takes human form to fulfill a purpose.
According to this law, you have a unique talent and a unique way of expressing it. There is
something that you can do better than anyone else in the whole world  and for every uniquetalent and unique expression of that talent, there are also unique needs. When these needs arematched with the creative expression of your talent, that is the spark that creates affluence.Expressing your talents to fulfill needs creates unlimited wealth and abundance.
If you could start children right from the beginning with this thought, youd see the effect it
has on their lives. In fact, I did this with my own children. Again and again, I told them there was
a reason why they were here, and they had to find out what that reason was for themselves.From the age of four years, they heard  this. I also taught them to meditate when they were
about the same age, and I told them, I never, ever want you to worry about making a living. Ifyoure unable to make a living when you grow up, Ill provide for you, so dont worry about that.
I dont want you to focus on doing well in school. I dont want you to focus on getting the best
grades or going to the best colleges. What I really want you to focus on is asking yourself howyou can serve humanity, and asking yourself what your unique talents are. Because you have aunique talent that no one else has, and you have a special way of expressing that talent, and noone else has it. They ended up going to the best schools, getting the best grades, and even in
college, they are unique in that they are financially self-sufficient, because they are focused on
what they are here to give.  This then, is the Law of Dharma.
There are three components to the Law of Dharma.  The first component says that each of
us is here to discover our true Self, to find out on our own that our true Self is spiritual, thatessentially we are spiritual beings that have taken manifestation in physical form. Were not
human beings that have occasional spiritual experiences  its the other way around: were
spiritual beings that have occasional human experiences.
Each of us is here to discover our higher self or our spiritual self. Thats the first fulfillment
of the Law of Dharma.  We must find out for ourself that inside us is a god or goddess in embryo
that wants to be born so that we can express our divinity.
The second component of the Law of Dharma  is to express our unique talents. The Law of
Dharma says that every human being has a unique talent. You have a talent that is unique in its33 The law of Dharme or purpose in life¶expression, so unique that theres no one else alive on this planet that has that talent, or that
expression of that talent. This means that theres one thing you can do, and one way of doing
it, that is better than anyone else on this entire planet. When youre doing that one thing, you
lose track of time. When youre expressing that one unique talent that you possess  or morethan one unique talent in many cases  the expression of that talent takes you into timelessawareness.
The third component of the Law of Dharma  is service to humanity  to serve your fellow
human beings and to ask yourself the questions, How can I help? How can I help all those that
I come into contact with? When you combine the ability to express your unique talent withservice to humanity, then you make full use of the Law of Dharma.  And coupled with the
experience of your own spirituality, the field of pure potentiality, there is no way you will not
have access to unlimited abundance, because that is the real way abundance is achieved.
This is not a temporary abundance; its permanent, because of your unique talent, your
way of expressing it, and your service and dedication to your fellow human beings, which youdiscover through asking the question, How can I help? instead of Whats in it for me?
The question, Whats in it for me? is the internal dialogue of the ego. Asking How can
I help? is the internal dialogue of the spirit. The spirit is that domain of your awareness where
you experience your universality. In just shifting your internal dialogue from Whats in it for
me? to How can I help? you automatically go beyond the ego into the domain of your spirit.While meditation is the most useful way of entering the domain of spirit, simply shifting yourinternal dialogue to How can I help? will also access the spirit, that domain of your awarenesswhere you experience your universality.
If you want to make maximum use of the Law of Dharma,  then you have to make several
commitments.
The first commitment is: I am going to seek my higher self, which is beyond my ego,
through spiritual practice.
The second commitment is: I am going to discover my unique talents, and finding my
unique talents, I am going to enjoy myself, because the process of enjoyment occurs when I go
into timeless awareness. Thats when I am in a state of bliss.
The third commitment is: I am going to ask myself how I am best suited to serve humanity.
I am going to answer that question and then put it into practice. I am going to use my uniquetalents to serve the needs of my fellow human beings  I will match those needs to my desire tohelp and serve others.
Sit down and make a list of the answers to these two questions: Ask yourself, if money was
no concern and you had all the time and money in the world, what would you do? If you wouldstill do what you currently do, then you are in dharma, because you have passion  for what you
do  you are expressing your unique talents. Then ask yourself: How am I best suited to servehumanity? Answer that question, and put it into practice.
Discover your divinity, find your unique talent, serve humanity with it, and you can gener-
ate all the wealth that you want. When your creative expressions match the needs of your fellowhumans, then wealth will spontaneously flow from the unmanifest into the manifest, from therealm of the spirit to the world of form. You will begin to experience your life as a miraculousexpression of divinity  not just occasionally, but all the time. And you will know true joy and
the true meaning of success  the ecstasy and exultation of your own spirit.The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶34APPLYING THE LAW OF DHARMA OR PURPOSE IN LIFE
I will put the Law ofDharma  into effect by making a commitment to take the following
steps:
(1) Today I will lovingly nurture the god or goddess in embryo that lies deep within my
soul. I will pay attention to the spirit within me that animates both my body and mymind. I will awaken myself to this deep stillness within my heart. I will carry the con-
sciousness of timeless, eternal Being in the midst of time-bound experience.
(2) I will make a list of my unique talents. Then I will list all the things that I love to do while
expressing my unique talents. When 1 express my unique talents and use them in the
service of humanity, I lose track of time and create abundance in my life as well as inthe lives of others.
(3) I will ask myself daily, How can I serve? and How can I help? The answers to these
questions will allow me to help and serve my fellow human beings with love.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
I want to know Gods thoughts...
the rest are details.
 Albert Einstein
The universal mind choreographs everything that is happening in billions of galaxies with
elegant precision and unfaltering intelligence. Its intelligence is ultimate and supreme, and itpermeates every fiber of existence: from the smallest to the largest, from the atom to the
cosmos. Everything that is alive is an expression of this intelligence. And this intelligence oper-
ates through The Seven Spiritual Laws.
If you look at any cell in the human body, you will see through its functioning the expres-
sion of these laws. Every cell, whether its a stomach cell, or a heart cell, or a brain cell, has itsbirth in the Law of Pure Potentiality.  DNA is a perfect example of pure potentiality; in fact, it is
the material expression  of pure potentiality. The same DNA existing in every cell expresses
itself in different ways in order to fulfill the unique requirements of that particular cell.
Each cell also operates through the Law of Giving. A cell is alive and healthy when it is in
a state of balance and equilibrium. This state of equilibrium is one of fulfillment and harmony,but it is maintained by a constant give and take. Each cell gives to and supports every other cell,
and in turn is nourished by every other cell. The cell is always in a state of dynamic flow and the
flow is never interrupted. In fact, the flow is the very essence of the life of the cell. And only bymaintaining this flow of giving is the cell able to receive and thus continue its vibrant existence.
The Law of Karma  is exquisitely executed by every cell, because built into its intelligence is
the most appropriate and precisely correct response to every situation as it occurs.
The Law of Least Effort  is also exquisitely executed by every cell in the body: it does its job
with quiet efficiency in the state of restful alertness.35 The law of purpose ¶Through the Law of Intention and Desire,  every intention of every cell harnesses the infi-
nite organizing power of natures intelligence. Even a simple intention such as metabolizing a
molecule of sugar immediately sets off a symphony of events in the body where precise amounts
of hormones have to be secreted at precise moments to convert this molecule of sugar into purecreative energy.
Of course, every cell expresses the Law of Detachment.  It is detached from the outcome of
its intentions. It doesnt stumble or falter because its behaviour is a function of life-centered,
present-moment awareness.
Each cell also expresses the Law of Dharma.  Each cell must discover its own source, the
higher self; it must serve its fellow beings, and express its unique talents. Heart cells, stomachcells, and immune cells all have their source in the higher self, the field of pure potentiality. Andbecause they are directly linked to this cosmic computer, they can express their unique talents
with effortless ease and timeless awareness. Only by expressing their unique talents can they
maintain both their own integrity and the integrity of the whole body. The internal dialogue ofevery cell in the human body is, How can I help? The heart cells want to help the immunecells, the immune cells want to help the stomach and lung cells, and the brain cells are listeningto and helping every other cell. Every cell in the human body has only one function: to help
every other cell.
By looking at the behaviour of the cells of our own body, we can observe the most extraor-
dinary and efficient expression of The Seven Spiritual Laws. This is the genius of naturesintelligence. These are the thoughts of God  the rest are details.
The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success  are powerful principles that will enable you to attain
self-mastery. If you put your attention on these laws and practice the steps outlined in this book,
you will see that you can manifest anything you want  all the affluence, money, and success
that you desire. You will also see that your life becomes more joyful and abundant in every way,for these laws are also the spiritual laws of life that make living worthwhile.
There is a natural sequence for the application of these laws in your daily life that may help
you to remember them. The Law of Pure Potentiality  is experienced through silence, through
meditation, through non-judgment, through communion with nature, but it is activated by the
Law of  Giving. The principle here is to learn to give that which you seek. Thats how you
activate the Law of Pure Potentiality. If you seek affluence, give affluence; if you seek money,
give money; if you seek love, appreciation, and affection, then learn to give love, appreciation,and affection.
Through your actions in the Law of  Giving you activate the Law of Karma.  You create
good karma, and good karma makes everything in life easy. You notice that you dont have toexpend a lot of effort to fulfill your desires, which automatically leads to an understanding of theLaw of Least Effort.  When everything is easy and effortless, and your desires keep getting
fulfilled, you spontaneously begin to understand the Law of Intention and Desire.  Fulfilling your
desires with effortless ease makes it easy for you to practice the Law of Detachment.
Finally, as you begin to understand all the above laws, you begin to focus on your true
purpose in life, which leads to the Law of Dharma.  Through the use of this law, by expressing
your unique talents and fulfilling the needs of your fellow humans, you begin to create whateveryou want, whenever you want it. You become carefree and joyful, and your life becomes an
expression of unbounded love.
We are travellers on a cosmic journey  star-dust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and
whirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. But the expressions of life are ephemeral, momentary,The Seven spiritual laws of Success ¶36transient. Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, once said, This existence of ours is as
transient as autumn clouds. To watch the birth and death of beings is like looking at the  move-
ments of a dance. A lifetime is like a flash of  lightning in the sky, Rushing by like a torrent down
a steep  mountain.
We have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share. This is
a precious moment, but it is transient. It is a little parenthesis in eternity. If we share with caring,lightheart-edness, and love, we will create abundance and joy for each other. And then this
moment will have been worthwhile.

In The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success,  I describe the virtues and associated principles that
have helped me and countless others to achieve spiritual satisfaction and material success. I amwriting to invite you to join me, and potentially millions of others worldwide, in the  Global
Network for Spiritual  Success, which will be based on the daily practice of these powerful
guiding principles.
Participation in the Network is open to anyone who chooses to practice The Seven Spir-
itual Laws. I have found it particularly fulfilling to concentrate on one law each day of the week,beginning on Sunday with the Law of Pure Potentiality  and concluding on Saturday with the
Law of Dharma.  Having your attention on a spiritual law will completely transform your life, as
it has mine, and if we collectively put our attention on the same law each day, we could soon
reach a critical mass of successful people that could transform life on planet earth
With my staff and friends, I suggest starting a study group of family, friends, or co-workers
where members meet once a week to discuss their experiences with the spiritual laws.
